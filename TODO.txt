This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 

# 1: Change Azure SQL database plan, the 100,000 vCore seconds do not seem to be enough, just me playing through the game once with two players used 700, and most people would take longer to play and have more people playing

# 1 b: Set Azure SQL network access to accept my device's IP address and the backend's IP address and no more.

# 2: write backend and db for Mechanical Arm Mission

# 2 b: In a perfect world: conjoin RoundResult and ArmRoundResult table into one inclusive table that works, can rename shots / grams to be "performance" or something and have it accept 4 solvers always. Then remove the unneccessary endpoints and begin work of making only one version of front-end pages like roundResults that can work for both games to reduce duplicate code. May also require some extra inputs sent to backend so that the same endpoints can service both games. Wouldn't change functionality at all but would clean and simplify the code. 

# 3 plug arm screens into main game controller to complete circuit. 

Improve mock Mechanical Arm screen:
 - Solver can make different choices for each Modules
 - goal is to make a minimum mass mechanical arm for a NASA space station
 - player IS NASA show some propaganda get them excited show how this is a real world example as if for the real ISS

Solvers:
    - Expert (for each function)
    - Novice (in the )

Return values:
    - Minimize mass 
    - Cost (not included in code but should be based on solver choices)

- ASK Professor: 
1. What is 'size' in playShort and playPutt, is it the distance to accept making a whole ie should it always be 0.5?
2. What is 'strategy' parameter (sometimes called with 0 and sometimes 1)
3. Play fairway should I use rule 1 (minimize distance to hole) or rule 2 (minimize strokes)

Add quiz at start and end (taking place of Yahtzee)

Make selector cards light up somehow so that they show which is selected

Add information (maybe as buttons or tooltips) throughout that helps explain how the golf game is relevant to ISE and tie things back in, also maybe to explain how to play and objectives better ( could have graphic at top showing all rounds and the current )
round players are in. Could place this in header, may also want to add "home" word to header idk. Should also improve logo.

Add horizontal line at shots = 35 on tournament stage 2 to show players they have to get above
(May be easier to just split up results into two graphs, those who scored above the minimal threshold and those who didn't just for that round, or may be easier to append to data being graphed a bunch of red points at exactly shots = 35 and various costs)

Potential optimization:
- websockets
- image hosting (flickr)
