This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 

1. Make solver sim functions hittable APIs so players can try them out individually. Pick numbers for ball now:
    Drive HoleDist = 700 (Entire hole length) only one hit
    Long BallNow = 700 (Also starts from Tee) ends when green reached
    Fairway Ballnow = 450 (total - avg professional drives)
    Short Ballnow = 450 (same as fairway)
    Putt Ballnow = 15 (Equal to green size)
    DON'T show costs, just show scores. DO save them into db. Let them learn what the best assignments are. 

2. Create playground after round 2 so that players can experiment with all options:
    T = tee = drive, F, L, S, G = green = putt.

3. Ask players a question to guage their perceptions like "Which solvers do you think are better for each modules?",
    (For each of the 5, ask who is the best solver. Allow multiple answers if they can't decide. )
    Then move on to LG, DS, DFG.

4. AFTER practice let them choose between architectures and solvers. 

- ASK Professor: 
1. What is 'size' in playShort and playPutt, is it the distance to accept making a whole ie should it always be 0.5?
2. What is 'strategy' parameter (sometimes called with 0 and sometimes 1)
3. Play fairway should I use rule 1 (minimize distance to hole) or rule 2 (minimize strokes)
