This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 


# 1 b: Major refactor could be: Folder for all core components that work for each game. Mechanical Arm folder with specific items, Golf folder with specific items. (rather than just default being golf)

# 2: Fix units of weight, score, and cost to be consistent IE stored in db and displayed correctly. (change weight to mass?)

# 3 b: Can add mechanical arm mission results to "All Results" page and have players choose between seeing golf and mechanical arm results

# 4 in tables add "renders" for numeric values that take numbers to fixed(2) if values are numbers

# 5 flex direction column in instructions in mobile view. Also words stick out of buttons on my phone in mechanical arm mission architecture sections on both experiment and game rounds (although they don't do it on mobile view in browser.)

# 6 After clicking "play round" on mechanical arm game screen, could show modal of rocket / space shuttle or laboratory until results page takes over (like a loading screen or like how golf ball animates), or could have "conveyor" belt move mechanical arm off the screen.

Add a function in backend that will write out all data for a session, I. E. if prof plays with his class it can essentially "export" that data to csv or something. Look into python writting csv files from sql? Might be nice to have. Currently just ran complex sql queries on Azure and saved the csv files from there. 

Potential optimization:
- websockets
- image hosting (flickr)
