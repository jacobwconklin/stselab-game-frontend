This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 

#1: SCALE UP stselab-games-backend plan to at least first basic level, it is too slow and weak rn. Ask professor about his budget / goals.

# 1 b: Maybe Change Azure SQL database plan? the 100,000 vCore seconds do not seem to be enough, just me playing through the game once with two players used 700, and most people would take longer to play and have more people playing. I don't know about 5DTU might be too little, and honestly pay as you go might be worth it for app that is rarely used. 

# 1 c: potentially establish system with professor where db and backend stay OFF until he turns them off (IE other professors wanting to use the tool simply contact him first and he turns them on at that time? This would suggest using stateless backend (may overcomplicate)) REALLY would just require hitting "STOP" on stselab-games-backend and that is all. Looks like backend CAN'T be serverless, so this would only help to prevent db from costing anything... ? May not be worthwhile.

# 2: continue to write backend and db for Mechanical Arm Mission: In a perfect world: conjoin RoundResult and ArmRoundResult table into one inclusive table that works, can rename shots / grams to be "performance" or something and have it accept 4 solvers always. Then remove the unneccessary endpoints and begin work of making only one version of front-end pages like roundResults that can work for both games to reduce duplicate code. May also require some extra inputs sent to backend so that the same endpoints can service both games. Wouldn't change functionality at all but would clean and simplify the code. [Argument against combining RoundResult and ArmRoundResult: fields of one of the games could change, especially arm which is still less fully decided on.]

# 2 b: Major refactor could be: Folder for all core components that work for each game. Mechanical Arm folder with specific items, Golf folder with specific items. (rather than just default being golf)

# 3: Fix units of weight, score, and cost to be consistent IE stored in db and displayed correctly. On end of golf tournament screen either remove player ability to go home and look at results (save that for end of mech arm mission).

# 3 b: Can add mechanical arm mission results to "All Results" page and have players choose between seeing golf and mechanical arm results

# 3 c: Add colored icon to mechanical arm mission results page that uses players color from golf game.

4 change weight to mass?

5 in tables add "renders" for numeric values that take numbers to fixed(2) if values are numbers

6 flex direction column in instructions in mobile view. Also words stick out of buttons on my phone in mechanical arm mission architecture sections on both experiment and game rounds (although they don't do it on mobile view in browser.)

7 After clicking "play round" on mechanical arm game screen, could show modal of rocket / space shuttle or laboratory until results page takes over (like a loading screen)

Improve mock Mechanical Arm screen:
 - Solver can make different choices for each Modules
 - goal is to make a minimum mass mechanical arm for a NASA space station
 - player IS NASA show some propaganda get them excited show how this is a real world example as if for the real ISS

Solvers:
    - Expert (for each function)
    - Novice (in the )

Return values:
    - Minimize mass 
    - Cost (not included in code but should be based on solver choices)

- ASK Professor: 
1. What is 'size' in playShort and playPutt, is it the distance to accept making a whole ie should it always be 0.5?
2. What is 'strategy' parameter (sometimes called with 0 and sometimes 1)
3. Play fairway should I use rule 1 (minimize distance to hole) or rule 2 (minimize strokes)

Add quiz at start and end (taking place of Yahtzee)

Make selector cards light up somehow so that they show which is selected

Add information (maybe as buttons or tooltips) throughout that helps explain how the golf game is relevant to ISE and tie things back in, also maybe to explain how to play and objectives better ( could have graphic at top showing all rounds and the current )
round players are in. Could place this in header, may also want to add "home" word to header idk. Should also improve logo.

Add horizontal line at shots = 35 on tournament stage 2 to show players they have to get above
(May be easier to just split up results into two graphs, those who scored above the minimal threshold and those who didn't just for that round, or may be easier to append to data being graphed a bunch of red points at exactly shots = 35 and various costs)

Potential optimization:
- websockets
- image hosting (flickr)
