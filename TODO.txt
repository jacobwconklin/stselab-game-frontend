This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 

ADD "Points" category so that values can be given in tournament stages and rankings made

- ASK Professor: 
1. What is 'size' in playShort and playPutt, is it the distance to accept making a whole ie should it always be 0.5?
2. What is 'strategy' parameter (sometimes called with 0 and sometimes 1)
3. Play fairway should I use rule 1 (minimize distance to hole) or rule 2 (minimize strokes)

ADD TYPES for all "any" placeholders

ADD ENUM for round numbers rather than raw ints
