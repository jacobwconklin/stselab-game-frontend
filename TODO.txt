This can outline the major TODOs so they can be ordered 

- ASK Professor: 
1. What is 'size' in playShort and playPutt, is it the distance to accept making a whole ie should it always be 0.5?
2. What is 'strategy' parameter (sometimes called with 0 and sometimes 1)
3. Play fairway should I use rule 1 (minimize distance to hole) or rule 2 (minimize strokes)

ADD TYPES for all "any" placeholders

ADD ENUM for round numbers rather than raw ints

ISSUES:
Buttons broken on amateur results and game page

ADD number of players who have submitted survey to survey submitted screen (after free roam) so host can wait until 
everyone is done submitting it.
